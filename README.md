# Section 4 Animation Principles
Before we animate a complex rig, let's understand the core principles of animation (Reference: AP_BCC)
Here are the lectures of the course for this section...

### 1 Section 4 introduction
+ Michael Introduces Section 4 of the course

### 2 What Is Animation?
+ The illusion of motion
+ In Blender it is not just about the object/character...
+ Animating of the camera can drastically change the staging
+ Bringing our models into life
+ If the number of images/frames per second is too long the illusion is broken
#### Recommended Reading
+ The illusion Of Life
+ Whist many concepts are applied to drawing, they equally apply to 3D animation

### 3 Frame Rate
+ Decided at the beginning of a project.
+ Suggest sticking to one frame rate throughout a project
+ Save the startup file with your chosen
+ Changing it mid-way can cause many headaches

### 4 Why Not Use Physics?
+ Physics is appropriate sometimes, falling and collapsing
+ You lose control as you give it to the physics engine
+ It can work well with many simple objects
+ Can help the process with previewing an idea to tweak later

### 5 Squash And Stretch
+ Can Give a sense of weight
+ Gives the view an idea of the material
+ Can be used mildly
+ Taken to extremes it can be comical
+ Volume should be maintain to remain convincing

### 6 Bone Based Squash and Stretch
+ Using an armature to deform our mesh

### 7 Re-targeting Animations
+ Super quick workflow when done
+ Naming has to be consistent
+ Naming is critical to this work flow working

### 8 Refining Squash and Stretch
+ Control bones may be necessary to fine tune movement
+ Caution adding unnecessary complexity

### 9 Expanding An Animation
+ Clean up current keyframes
+ Moving keyframes in bulk
+ Expand on existing animation data

### 10 Animating Can Be Hard
+ Make many little animations
+ Keep your old work to reflect on
+ Keep your old work to improve on
+ As your skills develop it will get easier

### 11 Using The Grease Pencil
+ Quick Overview of the grease pencil
+ Grease pencil colours and layers
+ You can use the grease pencil in most editors
+ How to use the grease pencil for making notes
+ Editing your strokes

### 12 Animating The Grease Pencil
+ Drawing on an object
+ Mapping out animation ideas

### 12a Anticipation

+ Gives the viewer a clue of what is about to happen
+ Often makes an animation look more realistic
+ Prepares viewers for the next action
+ Avoid competing actions in complex models and scenes

### 13 Pose To Pose - Keys
+ These are the start and end of the a particular action
+ Solidify what we have already been doing
+ Can be more that two, if the animation has multiple actions / parts
+ As the name suggests these are the KEY points in the animation

### 14 Pose To Pose - Extremes
+ The furthest an object or character will travel

### 15 Pose to Pose - Breakdown Poses
+ Ensures the correct transition between Extremes
+ In-betweens would be next, however since Blender is good at interpolation these are only required in edge cases

### 16 Straight Ahead
+ Useful for more organic or random movement
+ Great for movement that lacks a known end position
+ Creates a move dynamic movement
+ Both pose to pose and straight a head are often combined

### 17 Timing
+ Frame rate dependant
+ Can change the entire feeling of an animation
